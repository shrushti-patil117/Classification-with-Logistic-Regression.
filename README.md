# Classification-with-Logistic-Regression.
Day 4 – Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
Objective
To build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression.

Dataset Used
Breast Cancer Dataset

Steps Performed
Cleaned dataset (removed id and null columns)
Converted diagnosis column to binary format
Performed train-test split
Standardized numerical features
Trained Logistic Regression model
Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall
Plotted ROC curve and calculated AUC score
Explained sigmoid function
Performed threshold tuning
Key Learnings
Difference between Linear and Logistic Regression
Understanding sigmoid function
Precision vs Recall trade-off
ROC-AUC interpretation
Importance of feature scaling
Outcome
Successfully built and evaluated a binary classification model.
